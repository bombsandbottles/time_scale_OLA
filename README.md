*   Title: Time Scaling with Overlap and Add
*
*   Description:  A MATLAB implementation of time domain strechting/compression with overlap and add (OLA). 
*                  Optional pitch shifting via resampling.
* ========================================================================


Usage:  
====== 
	You can edit the window size and alpha (stretch parameter) for different time scaling effects.
	Use the pitch_on variable and set to either 1 or 0 to enable resampling to adjust the pitch of the audio.
